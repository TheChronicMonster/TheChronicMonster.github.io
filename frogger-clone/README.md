# ${1:Arcade Classic Frogger Clone}

This frogger clone uses object-oriented JavaScript and Canvas HTML to create an interactive game. The project used the dt parameter to keep movement the same on every computer. I also added the sprites, reset function and directions. All of my edits were made in app.js.

## Installation

Play this game live at http://thechronicmonster.github.io/frogger-clone/
fork it and manipulate the code or zip the file for local use. 
Send me your pull requests. :)

## Usage

Move the player with the arrow keys, left, right, up and down. When you reach the water or hit a bug the game will reset.

## Credits

Project completed while studying Udacity's Front-end Web Development Nanodegree.
