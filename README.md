## The Neighborhood Map

http://thechronicmonster.github.io/maps/
This single-page application highlights the places to see in Janesville by incorporating the Google Maps and FourSquare APIs. Knockout JS allows for scalability and bootstrap creates a mobile-responsive app. 

Simple Sidebar by Start Bootstrap powers the sliding list-view. See their site at http://startbootstrap.com

jQuery and JSON requests also power this app.

## Test-Driven-Development with JasmineJS

Red light/Greed light testing allows for intuitive development of code that is designed to never break. 

## Website Optimization 

http://thechronicmonster.github.io/views/pizza.html
Cameron's Pizza House sells some pretty amazing pizzas, but the website needed serious help with optimization and "dejankification." I optimized the images, for loops and math for smooth, 60 fps rendering and a page that loads in 350ms.
