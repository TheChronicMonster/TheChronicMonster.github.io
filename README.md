The Web Optimization project was much more intensive than I had expected. It has made me quesiton whether I am cut out for for front-end web development or not. Nevertheless, I press forward.

This website package is a basic web page holding an introducary homepage and a handful of links to various projects. All images have been compressed, Google Analytics have been entered into the HTML, and fonts references have been labeled for optimal speed. 

Pizza.html and main.js is where most of my time was spent. All CSS was inlined into Pizza.html and the bootstrap file was minified. A long form copy exists for your reading pleasure on this file and all other minified fiels.

Pizza's main.js creates an array of pizza ingredients and arrays of adjectives and nouns to create 46 random pizzas as well as two constant pizzas as defined in the html. 

I compressed the sliding pizzas and reduced their movement to well below 60 fps. The page loads in under 100ms. However, I was not able make the pizzas resize in less than 5ms. Currently, they reload in 22ms. 

document. was called several times throughout the main.js. This is very costly so variables were used in place everytime possible.

Working through this course has solidified the importance of research. Incountable pages of MDN and W3Schools were referenced throughout this code. One of the most revealing lessons was going through the code and looking at bits of code like the querySelector and createElement. This is a field where there's always something new to learn!'

All that's left for you to do is order a pizza and enjoy!



## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

### Getting started

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Some useful tips to help you get started:

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

We didn't cover the Navigation Timing API in the first two lessons but it's an incredibly useful tool for automated page profiling. I highly recommend reading.

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
