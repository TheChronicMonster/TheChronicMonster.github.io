# The Neighborhood Map

http://thechronicmonster.github.io/maps/

## Summary
My map of Janesville, WI highlights some local attractions for the city. Something for everyone is highlighted, local restaurants, bars and taverns, parks and places of entertainment. Use the filter bar to filter the list of predetermined locations, click on the list view to find the marker you'd like or click randomly on markers to see information as provided by the foursquare JSON response.

This single-page application implements google maps and foursquares' api. 

This project was built using the Knockout JS framework. It's an MVVM (model view viewmodel) that helps separate the view from the viewmodel. The MVVM framework allows exponential scaleability. jQuery is also used to help with JSON and infowindow population.

## Resources
Resources include stackoverflow, the Udacity forums, online hangouts with coaches, online hangouts with fellow students, Udacity online classes, knockmeout.net, google developer resources, foursquare api developer resource pages, jQuery documentation and knockout documentation.
